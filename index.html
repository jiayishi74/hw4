<p><strong>Results</strong> We identified the newly created .html file in our directory and opened it to compare its format to this markdown file. And we saw all that we had made, and behold, it was very good. Ghastly macros in the original markdown language were now rendered as neatly formatted results. There were  30 observations and 2 variables in the simulated dataset. The histogram of age ($\text{Age, years} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=57,,\sigma^{2}=225)$) demonstrated the distribution of age in two hypothetical populations under normal distribution and t-distribution, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> In walking you through syntax, do-file creation, queued commands, generated results, through to embedding neatly formatted output in .html, we believe you now have a sense of what that Stata might offer you. These ideas can be generalized to embedding results in .xlsx, .log, .dta, .docx, etc.</p>
